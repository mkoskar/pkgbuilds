    Subject: [PATCH] Skype display name support
    Maintainer: Miroslav Ko코k치r <http://mkoskar.com/>
    Version: v1

    This is a patch for bitlbee-3.2.2 and its skype protocol:

    * read DISPLAYNAME which corresponds to the name attached to skype contact
      manually through skype client
    * display name is available through ``info`` command
    * display name (if specified) takes precedence over full name so
      ``nick_format = %full_name`` returns display name with full name as a fallback
    * fix bug which caused only offline contacts to receive correct
      ``%full_name``-based nick names


twitter-account-tag-as-name.patch

    Subject: [PATCH] Use Twitter account tag as nick and channel name
    Maintainer: Miroslav Ko코k치r <http://mkoskar.com/>
    Version: v1

    This is a patch for bitlbee-3.2.2 and its twitter protocol:

    * twitter account is accessible now either under <account_tag> nickname
      or through #<account_tag> channel
    * in contrast to status quo (twitter_<handle> / #twitter_<handle>) it
      enables user to have a consistent namings, configurable by setting
      particular twitter account's tag
